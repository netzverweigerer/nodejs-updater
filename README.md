# nodejs-updater
Simple semi-automatic script that obtains a fresh NodeJS copy from nodejs.org

Will obtain a fresh copy of the latest tar/gz release for Linux x86-64
from nodejs.org and extract the contents to ./release/

Will also ask some stupid questions if there already is a release directory
or a downloaded tar/gz file.
